/* an I/O layer abstraction class that could be a pty or a pipe,
 * depending on whether an pty needs to be allocated or not. This makes the
 * session loop much more readable.
 * In the pty case, slave0, slave1, slave2 are all the same as only one pty
 * is needed for IPC. In pipe case, theres a pipe pair for each slave0/master0,
 * slave1/master1, slave2/master2 so that the session loop can distinguish between
 * stdout and stderr writes of the child and can mux this through the crash client.
 * This is good for some programs which require stdout/stderr split to distinguish
 * output data from errors (such as opmsg).
